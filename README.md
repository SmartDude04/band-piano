# Band Piano
### An idea based off Jacob Collier's [MIT visit](https://youtu.be/LdtK_oiyJAo?si=21nQyqail7QYp5wE)

In the video, he has a site where he can send notes to members of the band from a MIDI keyboard in the front

## How it works
Here, users can select an instrument, and it will show a staff with notes when selected.

From the conductors point of view, they will be able to see the notes for each instrument and change settings related
to how the notes are sent to the players

## Docker
Plans are to make this a deployable [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. More info will be provided when that becomes a possibility.
